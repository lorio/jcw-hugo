_Fake Lies_, © 2018  by Jeffrey Cyphers Wright is Fell Swoop 159.

>Fell Swoop in New Orleans just published “Fake Lies”. Those poems will end up in a collection called Dopple Gängster which is the new stuff I’m working on.

>Although the poems are stand alone, they call and echo each other. They’re about a central figure moving through the landscape, who tries to maintain an upbeat spirituality and the struggle to share that sensation.

>The poems, when they’re done, arrive at a place that is part mirror and part projection. They are a critique of our times while offering sage observations in compressed, musical phrases. They try to be fun and deep simultaneously.
