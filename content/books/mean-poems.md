Hard Press 2022

Equal parts funny and wicked, this collection by Wright is best suited for those who like a bit of fun. You, and he, make lemonade out of lemons. Not for the faint of heart.

Here's one that's fit to print:

>__Gang of Seven__

>I shot the sheriff.  
>Then I shot  
>the six deputies.  
>I chose the place.  
>They chose the time.  
>The seven hangmen  
>(and women)  
>got so tangled up  
>in their lines,  
>they bit off  
>each other's tongues  
>telling vicious,  
>pernicious lies.  

From the introduction:  

>_The Mean Poems_ are a direct response to the bad behavior of board members in an East Village community garden ... Wright takes a cue from the scathing pages of Catullus ...Revenge without calories ... Courage!
