Cinnabar dragonflies   
do a duet … mirrored below  
in the lake’s placid face.


Plastic Coke sign turned  
white by sun. Cute bathing suit  
suddenly seems worn.

Playing harmonica  
for curious geese, sassy  
crows heckle my notes.

A row of blue spots  
fanned across black velvet.   
Hi, butterfly coquette.

My lover strides out  
of the surf, smiling at her-  
self for getting wet.

Ocean, give me strength.  
I’ll submit to your green pulse.  
I’ll roar in a shell.
