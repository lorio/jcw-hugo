<p>Roots stick out from red clay. <br>I forget about my dream. <br>After rain, clouds tiptoe away.  </p><p>Number 87 slides <br>off the track, back wheels <br>aflame. Happy 4th.  </p><p>Hercules lying around &mdash;<br>stars spread out on night's <br>velvet pool of spilt ink.  </p><p>Taking a tick off Alex's neck, <br>dragon smoke floats across <br>tree tops before rain.  </p><p>The rain insists on its own <br>sentences. Its tattered hum <br>drums the bird-filled trees.  </p><p>Fairy wand beside the path. <br>I wish for forever. <br>Crows gathering at dusk.</p>

<p>Swan never hurries.<br>I too have no place to be.<br>Chokeberries falling.</p><p>After last night’s rain<br>a slew of mushrooms sets up<br>big tops on the lot.</p><p>The wind must like me.<br>Only <em>my</em> hat blows away<br>chasing umbrella.</p><p>Moon grows a white beard,<br>mist, wispy around its chin.<br>We must be mirrors.</p><p>Under the empress tree,<br>black butterfly between leaves<br>come to hear me play.</p>

<p>Parasol mushrooms,<br>caps atilt, make a grand show<br>waltzing with the moon.</p><p>Ants carry a dead moth<br>away in tiny pieces.<br>No time to quibble.</p><p>Lattice wings outspread,<br>a dragonfly has transpired.<br>Infinity sighs.</p><p>Across the river,<br>tallest steeple in Greenpoint.<br>Your dress teases a breeze.</p><p>Goose poop on sidewalk,<br>green goop. Watch your step, silly.<br>Don’t make up small fibs.</p><p>Woken by a bad dream,<br>I am not an imposter.<br>The Express whistles.</p>
