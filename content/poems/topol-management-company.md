<p>Often in the lonesome section<br>
I barbeque the mirror. Your laughter<br>
an elixir. Where sometimes means<br>
X and never means Y. There</p>

<p>we cross hairs in our new direction.<br>
Eating the bones of dreams, we<br> 
both have grown fatter but now<br>
is notorious and the speakerâ€™s patter</p>

<p>makes no sense although I discern<br>
a pattern of adaption.  Currently<br>
half past to die for.<br>
Waiting for the number one train.</p>
