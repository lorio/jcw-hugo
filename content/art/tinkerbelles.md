Tinkerbelle hovers over graffiti, detritus, and grass-roots advertising garnered from East Village walls and lamp posts. The backdrop is an Eden for her flights of fancy.

Tinkerbelle came into the picture around 2010 while Wright was teaching in the public schools and looking at or creating educational imagery, like coloring books. They have been exhibited in various East Village venues and establishments, including the East Village branch of Capital One Bank. Wright reproduced them on the covers of his zine [LiVE MAG!](http://livemag.org)
