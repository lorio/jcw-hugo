Wright taught science in an Upper Manhattan public school. His lessons were both educational and entertaining, especially entomology. The lab creatures serve double duty as new inspiration for his collage work.

With his expansive lens on the animal kingdom, Wright invites us to study the creatures with their counterintuitive color, emotion, and sensuality. The anthropomorphic subjects invoke our own dramas and illusions.

Wright is a long-time community garden activist. That concern for quality of life informs these microcosms of the endangered and vulnerable. The bestiary, mixed-media collages on recycled cards, highlights that aspect of his oeuvre that serves to delight the young at heart.
