Wright first created visual art in 1975. After moving to New York in 1976, he began working in collage regularly. He participated in Mail Art exchanges with Ray Johnson and John Evans among others. Wright started designing poetry reading announcements in 1978 for a series he began with Jim Brodey on St. Markâ€™s Place. He continues to create art for publications including 17 LiVE MAG! covers. For the past decade Wright has incorporated painting and drawing into his collages. These works typically include mythical characters, rubber stamps, antique paper, asemic writing, graffiti-esque gestures, and rock and roll stickers culled from East Village streets.
