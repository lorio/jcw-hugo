      <description>Hard Press 2022
Equal parts funny and wicked, this collection by Wright is best suited for those who like a bit of fun. You, and he, make lemonade out of lemons. Not for the faint of heart.
Here&amp;rsquo;s one that&amp;rsquo;s fit to print:
 Gang of Seven
I shot the sheriff.
Then I shot
the six deputies.
I chose the place.
They chose the time.

      <description>Blue Lyre 2018
Dos Madres Press
New York, NY
Jeffrey Cyphers Wright is a leading voice of New Romanticism in the American Underground. His 15th book is a collection of stand-alone poems that combine to form a powerful portrait of a citizen, lover, family member, and seasoned artist. Blue Lyre will pull your leg and your heartstrings.
 &amp;hellip;comments about relationships, bar-hopping, and the creative process, are all tied, sometimes transparently, sometimes obscurely, to an ecological perspective.</description>

He participated in Mail Art exchanges with Ray Johnson and John Evans among others. Wright started designing poetry reading announcements in 1978 for a series he began with Jim Brodey on St. Mark’s Place. He continues to create art for publications including 17 LiVE MAG! covers. For the past decade Wright has incorporated painting and drawing into his collages.</description>

      <description>Fake Lies, © 2018 by Jeffrey Cyphers Wright is Fell Swoop 159.
 Fell Swoop in New Orleans just published “Fake Lies”. Those poems will end up in a collection called Dopple Gängster which is the new stuff I’m working on.
Although the poems are stand alone, they call and echo each other. They’re about a central figure moving through the landscape, who tries to maintain an upbeat spirituality and the struggle to share that sensation.</description>

      <description>Radio Poems 2017
The Operating System
New York, NY
&amp;ldquo;You should always write with the radio on.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Ted Berrigan
 Not since Cocteau’s film, Orpheus, has a writer tapped into the poetic unconscious of the radio with such witty and marvelous results. Jeffrey Cyphers Wright’s &amp;lsquo;Radio&amp;rsquo; plays nonstop hit poems with an energizing staccato rhythm that brings the &amp;ldquo;divine monkey business&amp;rdquo; that is New York and its many underground scenes back to life.</description>

      <description>Cinnabar dragonflies
do a duet … mirrored below
in the lake’s placid face.
Plastic Coke sign turned
white by sun. Cute bathing suit
suddenly seems worn.
Playing harmonica
for curious geese, sassy
crows heckle my notes.
A row of blue spots
fanned across black velvet.
Hi, butterfly coquette.
My lover strides out
of the surf, smiling at her-
self for getting wet.
Ocean, give me strength.
I’ll submit to your green pulse.</description>

Wright taught science in an Upper Manhattan public school. His lessons were both educational and entertaining, especially entomology. The lab creatures serve double duty as new inspiration for his collage work.</description>

Three Crowns of Sonnets
by Jeffrey Cyphers Wright
Spuyten Duyvil
ISBN:978-1-881471-23-3
From the Urban Graffiti Review:
 Jeff Wright&amp;rsquo;s lyrical liberties propel the traditional sonnet on a worldwide dash. Every poem is &amp;ldquo;Made in&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; somewhere &amp;ndash;beginning with China. In the second poem, &amp;ldquo;Made in Hong Kong,&amp;rdquo; the initial entreaty beckons with musical sophistication: anagrammatic words coupled in a double-beat rhyme scheme.</description>

      <description>Roots stick out from red clay. I forget about my dream. After rain, clouds tiptoe away. Number 87 slides off the track, back wheels aflame. Happy 4th. Hercules lying around &amp;mdash;
stars spread out on night&#39;s velvet pool of spilt ink. Taking a tick off Alex&#39;s neck, dragon smoke floats across tree tops before rain. The rain insists on its own sentences. Its tattered hum drums the bird-filled trees. Fairy wand beside the path.</description>

      <description>Often in the lonesome section
I barbeque the mirror. Your laughter
an elixir. Where sometimes means
X and never means Y. There
we cross hairs in our new direction.
Eating the bones of dreams, we
both have grown fatter but now
is notorious and the speaker’s patter
makes no sense although I discern
a pattern of adaption. Currently
half past to die for.
Waiting for the number one train.</description>

Tinkerbelle came into the picture around 2010 while Wright was teaching in the public schools and looking at or creating educational imagery, like coloring books.</description>
