      <description>Often in the lonesome section
I barbeque the mirror. Your laughter
an elixir. Where sometimes means
X and never means Y. There
we cross hairs in our new direction.
Eating the bones of dreams, we
both have grown fatter but now
is notorious and the speakerâ€™s patter
makes no sense although I discern
a pattern of adaption. Currently
half past to die for.
Waiting for the number one train.</description>
