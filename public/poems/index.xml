      <description>Roots stick out from red clay. I forget about my dream. After rain, clouds tiptoe away. Number 87 slides off the track, back wheels aflame. Happy 4th. Hercules lying around &amp;mdash;
stars spread out on night&#39;s velvet pool of spilt ink. Taking a tick off Alex&#39;s neck, dragon smoke floats across tree tops before rain. The rain insists on its own sentences. Its tattered hum drums the bird-filled trees. Fairy wand beside the path.</description>

      <description>Often in the lonesome section
I barbeque the mirror. Your laughter
an elixir. Where sometimes means
X and never means Y. There
we cross hairs in our new direction.
Eating the bones of dreams, we
both have grown fatter but now
is notorious and the speaker’s patter
makes no sense although I discern
a pattern of adaption. Currently
half past to die for.
Waiting for the number one train.</description>
