Three Crowns of Sonnets
by Jeffrey Cyphers Wright
Spuyten Duyvil
ISBN:978-1-881471-23-3
  
From the Urban Graffiti Review:
 Jeff Wright&amp;rsquo;s lyrical liberties propel the traditional sonnet on a worldwide dash. Every poem is &amp;ldquo;Made in&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; somewhere &amp;ndash;beginning with China. In the second poem, &amp;ldquo;Made in Hong Kong,&amp;rdquo; the initial entreaty beckons with musical sophistication: anagrammatic words coupled in a double-beat rhyme scheme.</description>
