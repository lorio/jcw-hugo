      <description>Blue Lyre 2018
Dos Madres Press
New York, NY
Jeffrey Cyphers Wright is a leading voice of New Romanticism in the American Underground. His 15th book is a collection of stand-alone poems that combine to form a powerful portrait of a citizen, lover, family member, and seasoned artist. Blue Lyre will pull your leg and your heartstrings.
 &amp;hellip;comments about relationships, bar-hopping, and the creative process, are all tied, sometimes transparently, sometimes obscurely, to an ecological perspective.</description>

      <description>Radio Poems 2017
The Operating System
New York, NY
 Not since Cocteau’s film, Orpheus, has a writer tapped into the poetic unconscious of the radio with such witty and marvelous results. Jeffrey Cyphers Wright’s &amp;lsquo;Radio&amp;rsquo; plays nonstop hit poems with an energizing staccato rhythm that brings the &amp;ldquo;divine monkey business&amp;rdquo; that is New York and its many underground scenes back to life. &amp;ldquo;The odyssey is not easy,&amp;rdquo; but extremely rewarding, for here you’ll find the city in all its eccentric, deviant glory.</description>

Three Crowns of Sonnets
by Jeffrey Cyphers Wright
Spuyten Duyvil
ISBN:978-1-881471-23-3
From the Urban Graffiti Review:
 Jeff Wright&amp;rsquo;s lyrical liberties propel the traditional sonnet on a worldwide dash. Every poem is &amp;ldquo;Made in&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; somewhere &amp;ndash;beginning with China. In the second poem, &amp;ldquo;Made in Hong Kong,&amp;rdquo; the initial entreaty beckons with musical sophistication: anagrammatic words coupled in a double-beat rhyme scheme.</description>
