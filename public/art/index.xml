      <description>Wright first created visual art in 1975. After moving to New York in 1976, he began working in collage regularly. He participated in Mail Art exchanges with Ray Johnson and John Evans among others. Wright started designing poetry reading announcements in 1978 for a series he began with Jim Brodey on St. Mark’s Place. He continues to create art for publications including 17 LiVE MAG! covers. For the past decade Wright has incorporated painting and drawing into his collages.</description>

Tinkerbelle hovers over graffiti, detritus, and grass-roots advertising garnered from East Village walls and lamp posts. The backdrop is an Eden for her flights of fancy.
Tinkerbelle came into the picture around 2010 while Wright was teaching in the public schools and looking at or creating educational imagery, like coloring books.</description>
